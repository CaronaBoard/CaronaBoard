## What is CaronaBoard?

CaronaBoard is an open source project, with the goal of creating a way to optimize the use of cars in cities, contributing to reduce local traffic, reduce use of fossil fuel, and help people to connect to its friends and colleagues.

Different than other products such as [BlablaCar](http://www.blablacar.com), CaronaBoard aim is to remain free! In our view give ride is a matter of friendship! We based the entire idea on principles of friendship and comradery, and that you would spend the same fuel and money if you go alone or if you give ride to your friends/colleagues.  If they want to give the rider a contribution it is up to them, and the tool won't be designed to make money out from it.

### Product vision:

Below some ideas about the concept of CaronaBoard:

1. Free tool: CaronaBoard will be free, meaning that it won't be used to make money or provide tools for people make money
2. Connect people: the idea is simple, CaronaBoard has to allow people to easy communicate and get ride to each other.
3. Communities: the product will evolve to the idea of communities, so people can create a community for its workplace, or a group of friends. This will ensure you do not risk to get/give ride to someone you do not know or someone that can offer risk, specially in the current world where there is a lot of violence, prejudice and sexism. The idea is that in the future group administrator could allow people to join group or ban other members.
4. Collaboration: CaronaBoard idea is to be a collaborative project. Your ideas and contributions are welcome.

### Tech stack (for now)

Right now the project has an undefined tech stack. This definition is the first [2 issues](https://github.com/luismizutani/CaronaBoard/issues) in the [product roadmap](https://waffle.io/luismizutani/CaronaBoard). However there is a protorype version working to validate product's concept and get feedback from usage running in heroku. This first experimental version is using plain HTML, CSS and PHP.
